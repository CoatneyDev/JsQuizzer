[DEMO](http://yosemitematt.com) - Working demo

This simple quiz program demonstrates modern web concepts, architecture and best practices in a Fullstack MVC application.

When taking the quiz, answer all the questions. When the last question is answered the quizzer adds up and reports a score. If you perform less than jazzy simply Play Again!

## Why I Built This App

I built this app to demonstrate modern fullstack app development techniques including: PHP/Laravel, SCSS/ CSS3, ES5/6/7, GIT, Webservices API and more but mostly JAVASCRIPT.

JSQuizzer uses fundamentals of fullstack technology with an emphasis on latest vanilla Javascript and responsive design elements. There are no CSS or JS frameworks in use although Laravel is packaged with both. 

## Getting Started

1. Git the source and cd to project folder then install dependancies (using GitBash):

	```$ yarn install```

2. Project is using SQLite, so a database server is not necessary. But if a different setup is required simply change .env DATABASE configuration and then run the migrations and seed database.
From source folder run:

	```$ php artisan migrate```

	```$ php artisan db:seed```


## Built With

* [LARAVEL 5.8](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/installation) - PHP framework 
* [ES6+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources) - Javascript ES6 and some ES7
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Using SCSS pre-compiler
